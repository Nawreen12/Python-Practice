Variables in Python:
	A variable is just a container for storing data values.
X = 22
            print (X)
            22
       Here, X is variable and its value is 22. So when we print X it will interpret 22
          Y= ‘TEA’
Print ( Y)
Tea
Variable can be overwritten. 
Y='Tea'
Y= 'Coffee'
print(Y)
Coffee
Variables are case sensitive.
y='Tea'
Y= 'Coffee'
print(Y)
coffee.
	We can use multiple variables.
x,y,z ='Tea','Coffee','Soft drinks'
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
Tea
Coffee
Soft drinks
	We can use a value to multiple variables.
x=y=z= 'Water'
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
Water
Water
Water
	We can assign things like List, Dictionaries, tuple and set as a variable.
ice_cream = ['Chocolate','Vanilla','Cone']
x,y,z = ice_cream
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

Naming Variable:
Naming a variable is very important because it helps to understand others. We can name a variable in different way:
***#Camel Case
#Test Variable Case
testVariableCase = 'Vanilla'

***#Pascal Case
#Test Variable Case
TestVariableCase = 'Vanilla'



***#Snake Case
#Test Variable Case
test_variable_case = 'Vanilla'

***test_var = 'Vanilla'
testvar = 'Vanilla'
_test_var = 'Vanilla'
testVar = 'Vanilla'
Testvar'Vanilla'
Testvar2 'Vanilla'

We cannot name any variable like as following: 
***2testvar =’vanilla’
      test-var = ‘vanilla’	These doesn’t work 
      test,var=’Vanilla’
      test var =’vanilla’


Operators with Variables:
We can use ‘+’ sign and add two string.
x= 'Ice cream is my favorite' + "."
print(x)
Ice cream is my favorite.

We cannot add a string and a number together. Like
X= ‘Ice cream is my favorite’ + 2   
This will not work.

We can also add 2 integers together.
y=3+2
print(y)
5
We can also add multiple string with print statement. 
x= 'Ice cream'
y= ' is'
z= ' my favorite' 
print(x+y+z)
Ice ceam is my favorite'
We can add multiple number with print statement.
x= 2
y= 4
z= 4
print(x+y+z)
10
We can combine a string and a number separating by a comma.
x= 'There are' 
y= 2
z= ' Ice cream'
print(x,y,z)
There are 2 Ice cream.
